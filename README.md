# Lyuben-Gondov-employees
I made the application to work with all separators. I also remove employees from the table which did not work together. I just do not have enough time to make the things with database. I know that code first with Entity Framework Core should be used. I should use stored procedures that I made, with Code first approach after the migration in methods Up and Down.
